# Bikesharing

## Bikesharing Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a proposal, which will be presented to a potential angel investor interested in providing seed money for a bike share program in Des Moines. To achieve this, the bike share program in New York City is analyzed. Using tableau, visualisations are created to:


* >*Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all rides and generes.*
* >*Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.*
* >*Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.*

## Bikesharing Results

The above graphs highlight the top starting and ending locations in New York City.

The above graph highlight the peak riding hours in August. Based on the graph 17:00 (5PM) is the peak riding hour in August. 

3. 

![Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102786356/179351295-59f52d16-c465-48d6-958e-fa9b063c8ed3.png)

The above graph shows the total number of trips, the gender, breakdown, and the number of bike rider checkout times by users and also categorized by gender. Based on the information, August has over 2m riders with about 1.5m being male, about 500K female and about 225K unknown.

![Trips by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102786356/179351538-8fa6fd76-96ca-45e1-ac6a-93793950771c.png)

The above heat map highlights the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. Males participate the most in the bike riding program and they mostly ride in the week. They ride early in the morning and early in the evening . Most rides also occur early in the week and at the end of the week.

## Bikesharing Summary
Based on all the information presented it is safe to deduce that most bike rides take place early morning and early evening in the week. This tells us most riders use it primarily as a means of transport to and from work as opposed to leisurly. This will be successful in Des Moines if the weather is favorable and if bike stations are located within a few minutes of peoples' jobs. Being that lots of people, mostly males participate in the ride sharing program in NYC, it is prudent the population demographic of Des Moines is analyzed and visualized as NYC is a much bigger city.
